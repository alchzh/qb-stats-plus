## How to Build

(For review) This is a pretty simple extension built with webpack. It should
build on any Windows or Linux system. Will require some sort of display, in
order for puppeteer to generate the logo PNGs from the SVGs. If you run the
following commands,

`npm install`

`npm run logo`

`npm run build`

the built extension should be in the `dist/` folder.
